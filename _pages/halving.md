    <h2>반감기</h2>
    <p>210만개의 블록이 형성되는 시점인 2022년 1월(예상)에 레이븐코인의 첫 반감기가 있을 예정이며, 블록당 보상은 5,000 레이븐코인에서 2,500 레이븐코인으로 줄어들게 됩니다. 더 이상의 보상 반감량이 형성되기 어려운 시점까지, 매 210만개의 블록마다, 반감기를 거치게 됩니다.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-8">How many days is 2,100,000 blocks?</h3>
    <p>2,100,000 blocks = 1458.33333 days @ 1 minute blocks</p>
    <h3 class="mt-8">What is that in years?</h3>
    <p>1458.33333 / 365.25 = 3.992699 years (with one leap year)</p>
    <h3 class="mt-8">How accurate are those timelines</h3>
    <p>This is all dependent on the number of blocks, not calendar time. If the block speed is faster than one minute, it will be sooner. If slower, it will be longer than 3 years.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-8">Okay, but can I have an example?</h3>
    <p>Example: By counting blocks on November 18th, 2018, Ravencoin was at 315.57 days, but in calendar time, we were at 319 days. This difference was caused by our mining power being increased almost every difficulty adjustment in the first months after the start of the platform.</p>
